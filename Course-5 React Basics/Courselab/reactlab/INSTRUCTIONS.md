## Task

You've learned that you can add another component inside the App component, and then render that new component inside the App component's return statement. 
In this exercise, you'll practice doing just that. You will be instructed, step by step, to build a new component inside the App component, and to have it rendered on the screen.
Note: Before you begin, make sure you understand how to work with the Coursera Code Lab for the React Basics course.

## Steps

### **Step 1**

Add a new component to the `App` component, named as `Heading`.

- Navigate to the `src` folder and find the `App.js` file. Click on the `App.js` file in the EXPLORER to have it open.
- Now you're ready to add a new Component to the `App` component, and name that component `Heading`. Place it at the very top of the `App.js` file.

### **Step 2**

Inside the `Heading` component, include a `return` statement, which will return JSX code.
### **Step 3**

To the right of the `return` keyword, add the following JSX code: <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1> Displays H1 element on the screen.

### **Step 4**

- At the top of the lab environment, locate the Terminal menu. Click on it to open a dropdown, then select New Terminal.
- Once the new terminal is opened, it automatically navigates to the default project directory.
- Use the  `npm start` command to start the development server.
- You can now view the App in your browser by navigating to localhost:3000.
- To view the output, click on the Browser Preview icon located on the left panel. It is the last icon in the panel.
- In your browser, enter localhost:3000 to see the output.Heading element displays on browser.
